### - Overview
West Nile virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos.
In 2002, the first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in Chicago. By 2004 the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.

### - Problem Statement
Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, the task is to predict where and when different species of mosquitoes will be tested positive for West Nile Virus.

### - Selected Models
- Decision Trees with AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting

### - Success Metric
Success is evaluated using AUC-ROC curve between the predicted probability that West Nile Virus is present and the observed outcomes.
